# serpens.js

## Description

Serpens.js is a version of the classic snake arcade game. Please review [the readme in an earlier repo for a version of the game](https://github.com/dp-daly/js-snake) that ran solely in the browser.

In this repo, I am extending the game to include a rails backend. Functionality will include:
- A multi-page app, in contrast to the single page browser game
- Incorporation of rails' stimulus.js framework for an improved UI
- RSpec testing for backend ruby code, and Jest/Mocha testing for frontend javascript
- Feature: create a profile
- Feature: save and view scores
- Feature: high score view in gameplay
- Feature: leaderboard
- Feature: additional levels to gameplay

### Access

For now, you can play the browser version of the game in your computer browser here: https://dp-daly.github.io/js-snake/


## Technology

### Stack
- Ruby on Rails v8, including stimulus.js
- RSpec
- Jest/Mocha
- Devise

### Languages
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Capybara


## Improvements

Future improvements may include: 

* Optimisation for smartphones and tablets: this remains a browser game with backend functionality.

* Tailored character text and sound effects for the alternative theme.

* Additional visual cues for game over, such as flashing sprites and red animated text in the console to add emphasis.
